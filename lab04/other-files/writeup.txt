1. What corrections did you have to make?

One of my corrections is "Document language missing".

2. Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not?

Yes.
There is no error shown on the WAVE page, so all the accessibility problems are solved.

3. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

Yes.
Although the CSS builds up the style of my website, if I turn it off, the whole webpage will lack of structure, but it is still readable. Because all the infomation are still here.

4. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?

Yes.
If images were turned off, all the other infomation still there, users can keeping using the website without images.
